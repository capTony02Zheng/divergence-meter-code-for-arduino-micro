# divergence-meter-code-for-arduino-micro
// This is a project use for creating an divergence meter.
// Code are well written but need the user to update the IRdata to match the 1838IR remote control. Also the ds3231 module need to be updated with
//other code, which is not provided here.
// The PCB is developed with kiCAD.

// To start up from nothing, here's the few steps you need to follow:
// 1: Get all the component you need, which includes:
// An arduino micro board;
// A pcb that is printed with the file provided;
// A ds3231 time module;
// An IR1838 module with corresponding remote control;
// One or two 5v to 170v boost module;
// multiple resistors of 10k and 100k;
// four hv5523pg-g chips; you can buy some here: https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/hv5522#document-table
